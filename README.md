Upon reflection, it has been observed that there were many things that were learnt.That included the literal definition of a system and what was not a system. Alongside, the definitions and the differences of Complex Adaptive Systems and Complex systems. In relation to our social world and everyday lives, I have gained a deeper insight into how complex our human world is and how much our world revolves around a system. In general, anything that functions was considered a system as I personally use the word system as a catch-all phrase. After the lesson, my understanding of systems was enhanced as I understand that it is a relationship between groups of composed that are arranged in a particular way to perform a particular function. An example I now understand is a business department and how that creates a system. As such a business department is a system due to its element of Research and development, accounting, production, sales and more that interconnect as a function such as produce a good or service. Whereas, a group of people waiting at the train station are not a system as they are not designed to work together.For us people, students in university like me putting an effort to graduate is a common goal contributing to a complex adaptive system. Hence, I now understand the importance of how systems bring out the brainpower of the people involve and that it is vital in the evolution of a situation and identifying patterns of behaviours over time. 

A challenged I had encountered for this weak was starting up University and having a 3-hour workshop for this subject. This 3-hour workshop was quite difficult to focus on the whole zoom call. Hence, it was hard to understand the concept. 

This module enabled me to have a better thinking mindset for future activities. As such it showcased how viewing a function as a system in-depth enabled the understanding of the evolution and identifying patterns of behaviours over time.The theory of seeing functions as a complex system outlines the importance of systems for learning as it brings out the brainpower of people involved while providing effective structure and supporting the interest of delivering better results.

Upon reflection, it was observed how complex and diverse the world is. As such, we discussed how huamns,companies, governments and their behaviours produced a novel. The in-depth learning of different type of models unveiled that people who utilise models consistently outperform those who donâ€™t. 

Initially, I have never heard of the different types of models and how important they were in our everyday life. Hence, an insight I gained was how useful the utilisation of models was in assisting in making us better thinkers, to better organise information and to better make sense of different situations. It provided me with an opportunity to make better decisions such as figuring out the chances of winning a game through the use of models. The models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts, better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. In the future, If I was to start up a business, I would definitely utilise models to assist in the operation. 

A challenge I faced this week was the formation of groups. Since it was an online learning process, it was difficult to form groups with people I do not know. However, groups were randomly chosen and we created a group chat to get to know each other. 

Overall, my understanding of models was enhanced. I have come to understand how models are capable of embedding data that we humans lack and models are used very often than we realise.  As such, it is used in school to explain data, predict, explore possibilities and communicate ideas. When thinking about a problem, a lot of clarity can simply arise by going through the process of writing a model. Hence, putting models to use is key to understand human-centered complex systems. 

### Week 3: 9/03/21
From this content, I have embraced the concepts of modelling to make better decisions. By applying models in my decision making, I have created the potential for productivity in terms of challenging the behaviour of others, the decisions they make and then using this to make my own better decisions. The decisions people make can be rational, behavioural or rule-based. Within this, I have learnt there are a lot of dimensions and applying decisions models will allow me to gain insight into which choice makes me the happiest. Models to make decisions include the multi-criteria decision models, spatial choice Additionally, in this lesson we learnt the importance of time management and this was helpful not only for this subject but in our everyday lives.

For me, it was a completely new area of work and was very interesting to model how others behave. This modified the way I initially viewed the world as now I take in a deep aspect is modelling how people behave in different environments, their beliefs and emotions, how they have come to their decisions and predicting how people behave. For instance, this weeks lesson presented that any model thinking can be used to ideate various solutions to a given problem and it will minimise potential errors. When working individually and collaboratively to solve a problem, many ideas of various solutions arise. It will become difficult to narrow down all ideas into one simple idea. This will create room for potential errors.  Therefore, in this case, the many-model thinking approach can be taken, where we apply different models and reduce the risk of errors.

This theory showcased the useful aspects of modelling for predictions of how different people behave and identify underlying factors influencing it. The application and understanding of these models enhance the ability to have diverse assumptions on different interactions.
